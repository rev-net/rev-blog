## Introduction to Revnets - Development Status

- Jango introduces the session focusing on Revnets.
- Revnets are now consistently on testnets as of January.
- A prototype client for accessing Revnets is available at [revnet.app](https://www.revnet.app). Everything is still in the design phase.
- Redeploys of the protocol are happening on a weekly basis, which means data can be wiped regularly.

## Legal Considerations

- Rob-FromOpenEsquire addresses the legal framework around Revnets, including discussions about SEC regulations.
- Different legislative acts and their implications for Revnets are being examined.
- There’s an intent to compile guidance on legal issues surrounding Revnets, considering each project's unique aspects and requirements.

## Specificities of Revnet as a Protocol

- Revnets allow for modularity and future-proofing with predefined stages.
- Key parameters: duration, price, boost, exit tax, and buyback pool.
- Parameters set before deployment and are immutable.
- Main functions revolve around joining Revnets and exiting them.
- Revnets can have various applications including donation platforms, project funding, revenue distribution, etc.

## Individual Project Discussions

- Participants discussed how they envisage integrating Revnets into their unique projects.
- Projects include eth.limo (a proxy for decentralized web hosting), [Croptop](https://croptop.eth.limo/) (a templating engine), and Bananapus (a project involved in the experimental Revnet development).

## Brainstorming Token Utility and Revenue Models

- Tokens can offer various utilities, from a freemium model to governance or feature prioritization through staking.
- Lively discussion on sustainable token models including discussions on staking, minting, and exiting.

## Community Engagement and Marketing Ideas

- The importance of coherent marketing campaigns and strategies were discussed, learning from the [Juicecrowd](https://juicecrowd.gg)'s campaign experiences.
- Ideas for effective outreach included focusing on fewer but more vibrant projects or a robust overarching campaign.

## Potential for Donations

- The possibility to receive donations across different platforms (e.g. Twitter, Telegram, etc.) was discussed.
- Revnets aim to facilitate donations for open-source projects, potentially integrating with existing systems on social media platforms.

## Conclusion

The meeting touched on various aspects of Revnet implementation, legal considerations, and community engagement requirements. Revnets can greatly impact donation models for open-source projects and involve complex, diverse strategies that require good communication and understanding of the protocol. All discussions and brainstorming during this meeting serve as preparation for future implementations and campaigns to promote Revnets.
