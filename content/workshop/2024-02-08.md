## Main Topics Discussed:

- Deployment and testing for Bannyverse project
- Cross-chain functionality for Bannyverse
- Revnet configuration and deployment
- Potential extension and adaptability of the deploy script for future projects
- Cross-chain payment mechanism and the concept of a "sucker" for payments
- Legal and partnership considerations

## Detailed Summaries

### Bannyverse Project Deployment

The Bannyverse project is being prepared for deployment on testnets with the
aim to move to production towards the end of the month. The focus is on
deploying the original Bannyverse deploy script, which now includes cross-chain
functionality thanks to the addition of "sucker" components for handling
payments across different blockchains.

### Cross-Chain Functionality

A significant portion of the meeting was dedicated to discussing the cross-chain
aspects of the project. This includes ensuring that Bannyverse can sell on
mainnet, on Optimism, and on other chains going forward. The underlying
infrastructure allows for revenue on any chain to funnel into the same Revnet,
representing an advancement towards "Ethereum multiculturalism". The discussion
also covered the technical challenges and solutions related to deploying across
multiple chains.

### Revnet Configuration and Deployment

The Revnet for Bannyverse, which aggregates revenue from various sources, is a
critical piece of the project. The deploy script for setting up the Revnet was
reviewed, highlighting the process for defining constants, configuring payment
terminals, and setting up stages for token issuance. The script is considered a
significant achievement, allowing for a comprehensive deployment with a compact
piece of code.

### Deploy Script Extension and Adaptability

There was considerable discussion on how the deploy script could be extended or
adapted for future projects. The need for a user-friendly interface was
acknowledged, as well as the possibility of making the deployment process more
generic for various types of projects. The concept of using the deploy script
for different project configurations was visited, emphasizing the script's reuse
potential.

### Cross-Chain Payment Mechanism

The concept of a "sucker" was introduced as a mechanism for handling payments
across chains. This component allows for payments to be "sucked" from one chain
to the project's primary chain, facilitating a unified revenue stream. The
meeting explored how to incorporate this component into the deployment process
and its implications for future deployments.

### Legal and Partnership Considerations

While much of the discussion focused on technical details, there were brief
mentions of legal and partnership considerations. The need for risk management
with cross-chain deploys was highlighted, as well as the challenge of ensuring
that people contribute to the Revnet instead of bypassing it. Additionally, the
possibility of applying the deploy script and Revnet model to other projects was
discussed in the context of fulfilling legal and partnership requirements.

## Ancillary Discussions

- Optimization and troubleshooting for deploy script implementation.
- Mechanisms for ensuring revenue contribution directly to the Revnet.
- The adaptability of the deploy script for various project configurations.
