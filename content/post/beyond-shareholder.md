# Beyond the Shareholder Model

_by pfitzy12 – originally shared on Discord_

TLDR:

- Competitive theory (ex. Porter’s Five Forces) gives a great model for strategy
  in a landscape of independent competing firms, but fails to provide a good
  model for dependent cooperative firms. Open source networks need a new model.
- The corporation and associated shareholder model is anachronistic to the logic
  of the internet. Open source contribution should outcompete centralized org
  structures in software if users, investors and teams are properly aligned.
- Lack of corporate oversight and deterministic / programmable treasuries has
  led to DAO team malfeasance and / or misguided treasury strategies that are
  value destructive.
  - Ie. airdrops, liquidity mining, protocol owned liquidity, point systems etc
- Networks should be cooperatively owned and any stakeholder that adds value to
  them should be compensated fairly.
- We need to find a **stable** way to **finance**, **grow** and **govern
  networks** on the **internet**

The RevNet yellow paper starts out with the framing statement :

The shareholder-owned corporation is an outdated framework conflicting with the
logic of open-source, user-owned software.

One key factor supersedes all secondary explanations : **misaligned
incentives.**

In traditional corporations, diverse stakeholders often clash, and power
dynamics typically favor shareholders. In contrast, a user-owned software
network erases stakeholder distinctions, fostering a unified focus on long-term
stability and growth rather than short-term incentives dictated by a privileged
few. In the realm of Web3, sustainable networks thrive on cooperation. It's
essential to strike a balance in incentives for teams, users, partners, and
investors; otherwise, participants may seek greener pastures elsewhere. While
compatible with a free market, this approach diverges significantly from the
traditional firm's long-term objectives.

## The Shareholder Model

The shareholder model prioritizes the interests of investors over other
stakeholders - users, employees, partners, and communities.

Concerning users, the central misalignment lies in the drive for maximum profit
extraction. Given the zero marginal cost of software distribution, not only is
this unnecessary, but it can impede network growth if users migrate to more
affordable alternatives or lack sufficient incentives for their value creation
and continued network propagation.

Shareholder models also prioritize profits over the interests of employees. The
model prioritizes shorter time horizons reinforced with stock options over
predictable salaries as well as short term growth hacks and M&A at the cost of
longer time horizon R&D and employee training. Corporations prefer shorter time
horizons. Employees prefer longer time horizons.

With partners, conventional strategy informs a view of charging buyers the
maximum they are willing to pay and paying suppliers the minimum they are
willing to accept. A simplistic view of stock price is the delta between this
willingness to pay and supplier opportunity cost over time discounted back to
the present. If the lines of ownership between firms erode via tokens, the
desire to extract the most you can might be short sighted if it undermines long
term stability and growth.

Local communities can face adverse effects as well. Driven by the allure of job
opportunities and tax revenue, corporations may inadvertently drain resources
from local areas and channel them towards distant shareholders. From a network
ecology standpoint, this preference for efficiency can compromise resilience and
redundancy, as the departure of a corporation can deal a severe unabsorbable
blow to the local economy. Furthermore, there may be additional detrimental
environmental externalities to consider.

Under the shareholder model, corporations are motivated to assess the expected
impact of market forces and strategically position themselves in segments where
these forces work in their favor. The ideal scenario involves a growth in return
on invested capital when the position is robust, the value chain is well-suited,
and execution is optimal. Conversely, if market forces are weak, and the value
chain is ill-fitted or inadequately designed for competition in that market, the
return on invested capital is expected to erode.

While the corporation has proven to be an optimal governance structure for
competitive, independent companies, it falls short for an open-source network
reliant on a collaborative ecosystem of individuals and firms. When a governance
framework is inadequately aligned with the technology of the era, surface-level
symptoms inevitably emerge. The prevalence of issues such as rug pulls, VC
dumping, airdrop farming, mass marketing, and the concentration of power in core
teams or voting cartels can be attributed to embedded incentives in existing
fundraising and go to market strategies and tools combined with a lack of
effective corporate controls.

We must shift away from constructing with the mindset of castles, moats, and
strategic power. Instead, let's envision open source through the lens of
lego-like modularity, bridges for connectivity, and meta-cooperation facilitated
by incentives.

We need to find a **stable** way to **finance**, **grow** and **govern
networks** on the **internet**.
