#### A Revnet serves as a productive place for organizations to point their revenues, encouraging:

1. Growth-oriented participation from investors, builders, and customers alike.
2. Sustainable fee structures that work for all participants.
3. Transparent, public-facing operations without priviledged powers or
   governance burdens.

Revnets are great for monetizing and growing open source applications,
collecting fees from onchain mechanisms, managing loyalty credits, and
potentially many domains not yet explored. They are an efficient evolution of
capitalism only expressible through blockchain contracts.

#### Unlike corporate cap-tables:

1. Revenues flow into a smart contract, not a company bank account.
2. Shares are fully backed by revenues and issued when new payments are
   received.
3. Access to revenues requires the forfeiture of shares by those choosing to
   prioritize immediacy over more valuable access later.

#### Unlike governed DAOs:

1. Entry and exit conditions are immutable, set during network deployment.
2. Tokens are backed by a common treasury, motivating collaboration by
   self-interested participants.
3. Hostile takeovers and rug pulls are prevented.

#### Unlike revshare agreements:

1. Retail customers participate in the network's revenue growth alongside the
   "creator class".
2. Access to revenue is distributed, not actual revenue – those who wait to
   access share more.
3. Future generations of investors and customers support earlier generations via
   scheduled price increases.

#### Unlike orderbook markets:

1. Price stability is maintained through ceiling and floor mechanisms, both
   contributing to increased network value.
2. Long-term holders are prioritized over those timing market peaks.
3. Pump and dumps benefit the network rather than exploit it.

#### Unlike builder-owned companies:

1. A percentage of newly issued shares can be reserved for builders, decided at
   project inception.
2. Builder shares function like all other shares, and so must be excersized to
   access the network's revenue.
3. Strong contractual guarantees protect investors and customers against scams.

#### Unlike pyramid schemes:

1. Revenue is generated through genuine value-adding business activities instead
   of relying on recruitment.
2. Operations are transparent and within legal frameworks, allowing participants
   to understand how revenue is generated and distributed.
3. Debt is assumed by fee-paying customers and voluntary investors, and is
   passed incrementally, predictably, and ceremonially from one generation of
   voluntary participants to the next, without need to orient towards retail
   extraction.

#### Unlike retail extractive businesses:

1. Customers are rewarded for network growth efforts.
2. Network shares are returned to customers with every fee payment.
3. Investors and customers are treated equally if they engage at a similar point
   in time.
