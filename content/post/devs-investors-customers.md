Retailist networks blur the lines between different types of network participants, but can still mean different things for people with different intents.

_For context as to why the following statements apply, look through these short posts [introducing Retailism](https://jango.eth.limo/9E01E72C-6028-48B7-AD04-F25393307132), [understanding Retailism through the lens of CAC and LTV](https://jango.eth.limo/572BD957-0331-4977-8B2D-35F84D693276), and [modeling Retalism](https://jango.eth.limo/B762F3CC-AEFE-4DE0-B08C-7C16400AF718/)._

### Devs and Entrepreneurs

*Deploying a Retailist network in support of a project can be productive for devs and entrepreneurs who:*

- are building open source software or smart contracts, and are unsure how to monetize its use to support themselves, their network, and their product’s evolution.
- believe a network of their product’s fans is more capable of growing itself rather than growing through their strategic efforts.
- prefer to spend their time building rather than shilling.
- prefer encouraging their network to teach each other, troubleshoot issues, and contribute to solutions alongside them.
- prefer to scope down the burden of management and treasury governance, or absolve these burdens altogether.
- prefer letting anyone invest from the get-go.
- prefer adhering to smart contracts rather than legal contracts.
- prefer relating to a network’s value on equal terms alongside all investors and customers.
- prefer working alongside their users rather than extracting from them.

*It is not recommended for builders who:*

- are making products which by their nature require centralized operation or the maintenance of secrets.
- want to remain in control.
- prefer building exclusive relationships with investors.

### Investors and Capital Allocators

*Chipping in to a project’s Retailist network can be productive for investors who:*

- want strong guarantees as to what might happen to their money given a few tractable projections.
- want to have their allocations derisked, with clear time horizons, success conditions, and failure signals.
- want strong guarantees as to how they’ll be able to access their money once allocated.
- want to be among a broader network of incentivized parties working towards a shared goal.
- prefer adhering to smart contracts rather than legal contracts. 
- prefer relating to a network’s value on equal terms alongside all devs and customers.

*It is not recommended for investors who:*

- want to remain in control.
- want to operate within familiar corporate structures.
- prefer building exclusive relationships with devs and entrepreneurs.
- prefer orienting towards retail extraction.

### Customers and Users

*Paying fees to a project’s Retailist network can be productive for customers who:*

- wish to be treated as investors.
- believe their word-of-mouth and feedback have value.
- don't mind paying for things but want to know exactly what they're paying for and where the money is going.
- do not want their choices to be taken advantage of.
- prefer relating to a network’s value on equal terms alongside all devs and investors.
