## Tokens in the Juicebox Ecosystem

### $JBX

- Address: 0x4554cc10898f92d45378b98d6d6c2dd54c687fb2
- Function: $JBX is a revenue-backed governance body supporting the Juicebox
  ecosystem. Collects investments, fees from Juicebox V3 protocol, and governs
  other assets.
- Access: https://juicebox.money/@juicebox
- Key Features:
  - Mint $JBX using ETH based on the current issuance rate (~50,000 $JBX/ETH).
  - Option for $JBX buybacks if market price is better than new issuance.
  - $JBX buybacks and issuance split 50-50 between fee payers and $JBX
    governance.
  - Redeemable for accumulated revenues.
  - Governance rights to allocate shared treasury revenues, adjust issuance and
    redeem strategy.

### $NANA

- Address: soon
- Function: $NANA is like $JBX but with no governance, no payouts, and with
  multi-chain support. It collects investments and fees from the Juicebox V4
  protocol across chains.
- Access: soon
- Key Features:
  - Mint $NANA using ETH or other coins.
  - Option for $NANA buybacks if market price is better than new issuance.
  - Majority of $NANA buybacks and issuance governed by $JBX.
  - Redeemable for accumulated fees.
  - No governance, treasury runs as a revnet.
  - V4 adds multi-chain multi-token and multi-fork conveniences, verbiage
    changes, removal of rarely used functions, the ability to schedule multiple
    rulesets ahead of time, and other niceties and optimizations. It is
    experimental and not yet as stable as V3.
  - $NANA is a treasury-backed token across Ethereum Mainnet, Optimism, and any
    number of L2s into the future.

### $REV

- Address: soon
- Function: $REV bets on the revnet ecosystem. It manages donations,
  investments, and revenues from building revnet tools and allocating to
  revnets.
- Access: soon
- Key Features:
  - Mint $REV using ETH or other coins.
  - Option for $REV buybacks if market price is better than new issuance.
  - $REV buybacks and issuance split 50-50 between fee payers and the revnet.eth
    multisig.
  - revnet.eth uses its balance to bet on revnets, making them more accessible,
    useful, and investible through apps, tools, and storytelling.
  - Redeemable for accumulated revenues.
  - No governance, treasury runs as a revnet.
  - $REV is built on the Juicebox V4 ($NANA) protocol.
